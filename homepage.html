    <h3>Why are croissants unique?</h3>
    <p>There are two big differences between baking a typical pastry and a croissant that gives this crescent-shaped treat its unique qualities. First, croissants are a yeast pastry, and you'll need to make a preferment before you make the dough. ... Second,
        croissants are laminated.</p>
    <h3>Why is France famous for croissants?</h3>

    <p>Because, the truth is, croissants aren't really French at all. ... Rumour has it that Marie Antoinette, who was born in Vienna, brought the croissant back to Paris in 1770. However, the pastry only became widely popular in France during the mid-19th
        century when a Viennese baker opened his patisserie in Paris in 1838</p>
