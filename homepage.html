    <h1>All about Croissant </h1>



    <h3>Why are croissants unique?</h3>
    <p>There are two big differences between baking a typical pastry and a croissant that gives this crescent-shaped treat its unique qualities.
        <br> First, croissants are a yeast pastry, and you'll need to make a preferment before you make the dough. ... Second, croissants are laminated.</p>
    <h3>Why is France famous for croissants?</h3>

    <p>Because, the truth is, croissants aren't really French at all. ...Rumour has it that Marie Antoinette, <br> who was born in Vienna, brought the croissant back to Paris in 1770. However, the pastry only became widely<br> popular in France during the
        mid-19th century when a Viennese baker opened his patisserie in Paris in 1838</p>
